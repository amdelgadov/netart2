        <h3> Netart or not Netart </h3>
        <p>This is one of brian mackerns work, where he involved himself as a part of the people that started using Net art (or internet art) emerged in the 1990s as artists began using the web not just to show art, but as the medium itself. Instead of paintings or sculptures, these works used:HTML, JavaScript, and multimedia files </p>

        <h3>Birans Vision in NETART or NOTART</h3>
        <p>Mackern's work is both poetic and experimental, often merging sound, code, and network structures. Key aspects include, netart_latino database. A major online archive of Latin American net art, both artwork and meta-artwork—a reflection on the presence (or absence) of Latin American artists in global digital networks. Another one is machinations and soundtoys, Interactive sound and visual environments where users “play” with systems and data. Lastly, he also collaborated on these correspondence pieces: Digital works that evolve through email exchanges, live coding, and network communication. Mackern treats the network itself as a collaborative, living space—not just a tool.</p>

        <h3>Birans Vision in NETART latino database </h3>
        <p>Brian Mackerns netart_latino database is a hybrid part artwork, part archive, part network. It doesn’t just collect Latin American net art. It is a Latin American net art: a living, decaying, poetic structure that mirrors the social and technological networks it documents. The project was structured as an evolving hyperlinked archive, built in early web technologies like HTML, PHP. Each entry corresponded to an artist or project. Entries included links, brief descriptions, and metadata. It includes visibility and marginality of making Latin American artists visible within global digital discourse. It allows Memory and decay, treating it like broken links and lost files as cultural traces, not failures. Networks as art forms, this make the database itself an aesthetic and social network. Decentralized knowledge: rejecting the Euro-American dominance of early internet histories.  At first glance, the project looks like documentation. But it’s also: A curated system of relations, the form is the content. A networked self-portrait of a region’s digital imagination. A performative gesture: each update, link, and metadata entry is a creative act of giving visibility and meaning..</p>
